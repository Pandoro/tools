Tools for many things

Mainly my little tool box for training neural networks based on python and some data loading utilities. Please be careful when looking at this stuff. Code might be seriously ugly and was not meant to generalize to everything else. You can look at it and play around with it if you must, but a lot of it might not work as you expect it to. Otherwise have fun with whatever you find.
